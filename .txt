[].js
treats like dynamic segment 

import { useRouter } from 'next/router' use to get the values from the path in browser -> 
const router = useRouter() ->
const {productID, reviewID} = router.query; ->
then now I can render the values of this variables in my jsx or tsx -> 

import {useRouter} from 'next/router'
function Home () {
    const router = useRouter()
    const {productID, reviewID} = router.query; // by using this way I'm able to distract the values that router carry.

    return <h2> product review for {productID} is the following -> {reviewID} </h2>
}
